3. Most Expensive Pizza
SELECT pizza_name, price
FROM pizzas
ORDER BY price DESC
LIMIT 1;

4. Most Popular Pizza Sizes

  Recommendations

Focus on Best-Sellers:  Keep best-selling pizzas well stocked and promote them regularly.
Improve or Remove Weak Performers:  Adjust recipes/marketing or consider dropping low-selling pizzas.
Inventory & Staff Planning:  Stock popular sizes more, and schedule more staff during lunch/dinner rush.
Upsell Premium Pizzas:  Market Greek Pizza as a premium offering.
Category Promotions:  Bundle popular and weaker pizzas (e.g., Classic + Veggie deals).
Targeted Marketing:  Offer discounts during off-peak hours.
Track Growth Regularly:  Continue monitoring revenue trends monthly to guide strategy.
